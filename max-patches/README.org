* Max Patches

To use any of the ambisonic patches in this folder, *make sure to install the ICST and HISS externals* from the Max package manager. Additionally, installing [[https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/spat/][SPAT for Max]] is required if you would like to use VBAP with [[./ambisonic-output.maxpat][ambisonic-output]] or [[./ambisonic-output-max7.maxpat][ambisonic-output-max7]]. Unfortunately, SPAT must be installed manually, as it does not exist in the Max package manager.

| [[./aedpanner.maxpat][aedpanner]]                             | Patcher that helps with doing aed panning with ICST's ambisonic encoders/decoders. Includes safeguards.                                                                                                             |
| [[./ambipanner.maxpat][ambipanner]]                           | Helper patch that is needed for [[./ambisonic-output.maxpat][ambisonic-output]].                                                                                                                                    |
| [[./ambisonic-output.maxpat][ambisonic-output]]               | An updated version Tanner Upthegrove's ambisonic encoder and decoder for ICAT's spaces, updated to not crash on Max 8. Includes speaker coordinates built-in. Uses ICST's max externals with HISS for ambisonic reverb. Make sure to also get [[./ambipanner.maxpat][ambipanner]]. This patch supports ambisonic impulse responses for reverb. Make a folder named "Impulse Responses" in the same directory as this patch and use ambisonic impulse responses from [[https://www.openair.hosted.york.ac.uk/][Openair]]. Use this patch with [[../Reaper-Templates/64ChannelSpatialMixerTEMPLATE.RPP ][64ChannelSpatialMixerTEMPLATE.RPP]] to have a DAW-like working environment for the spatial audio.        |
| [[./ambisonic-output-max7.maxpat][ambisonic-output-max7]]     | Tanner Upthegrove's original ambisonic encoder and decoder for ICAT's spaces. Will probably crash on Max 8, so definitely use [[./ambisonic-output.maxpat][ambisonic-output]] if not on Max 7. Requires [[./ambipanner.maxpat][ambipanner]]. Make a folder named "Impulse Responses" in the same directory as this patch and use ambisonic impulse responses from [[https://www.openair.hosted.york.ac.uk/][Openair]]. Use this patch with [[../Reaper-Templates/64ChannelSpatialMixerTEMPLATE.RPP ][64ChannelSpatialMixerTEMPLATE.RPP]] to have a DAW-like working environment for the spatial audio. |
| [[./simple-ambisonic-output.maxpat][simple-ambisonic-output]] | An adaptation of [[./ambisonic-output.maxpat][ambisonic-output]] that doesn't include SPAT and uses mc. Requires [[./ambipanner.maxpat][ambipanner]] to allow sending data from Reaper. Make a folder named "Impulse Responses" in the same directory as this patch and use ambisonic impulse responses from [[https://www.openair.hosted.york.ac.uk/][Openair]]. |
| [[./clicktrack.maxpat][clicktrack]]                           | Abstraction patch that can be used to make a click track easily in another patch.                                                                                                                                   |
| [[./clicktracktest.maxpat][clicktrack-test]]                  | Test patch for [[clicktrack.maxpat]]. Use this to understand how [[clicktrack.maxpat]] works.                                                                                                                       |
| [[./xyzpanner.maxpat][xyzpanner]]                             | Patcher that helps with doing xyz panning with ICST's ambisonic encoders/decoders. Includes safeguards.                                                                                                             |
