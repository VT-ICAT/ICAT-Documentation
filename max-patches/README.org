| [[./aedpanner.maxpat][aedpanner]]                     | Patcher that helps with doing aed panning with ICST's ambisonic encoders/decoders. Includes safeguards.                                                                                                                                     |
| [[./ambipanner.maxpat][ambipanner]]                   | Helper patch that is needed for [[./ambisonic-output.maxpat][ambisonic-output]].                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[./ambisonic-output.maxpat][ambisonic-output]]       | Tanner Upthegrove's ambisonic encoder and decoder for ICAT's spaces. Includes speaker coordinates built-in. Uses ICST's max externals. Make sure to also get [[./ambipanner.maxpat][ambipanner]]. This patch supports ambisonic impulse responses for reverb. Make a folder named "Impulse Responses" in the same directory as this patch and use ambisonic impulse responses from [[https://www.openair.hosted.york.ac.uk/][Openair]]. |
| [[./ambisonic-output-mc.maxpat][ambisonic-output-mc]] | An adaptation of [[./ambisonic-output.maxpat][ambisonic-output]] that doesn't include SPAT and uses mc. It should also crash less on Max 8, and be less resource intensive.                                                                 |
| [[./clicktrack.maxpat][clicktrack]]                   | Abstraction patch that can be used to make a click track easily in another patch.                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[./clicktracktest.maxpat][clicktrack-test]]          | Test patch for [[clicktrack.maxpat]]. Use this to understand how [[clicktrack.maxpat]] works.                                                                                                                                               |
| [[./xyzpanner.maxpat][xyzpanner]]                     | Patcher that helps with doing xyz panning with ICST's ambisonic encoders/decoders. Includes safeguards.                                                                                                                                     |
