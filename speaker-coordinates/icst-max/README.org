| [[./DISIS 26 Channel.xml][DISIS 26 Channel]]                               | For DISIS with speakers on ceiling configuration. This is now the current setup.                                                                  |
| [[./Perform Studio Cube-like Facing.xml][Perform Studio Cube-like Facing]] | Perform Studio with front being north. Can be used if a project has been using the Cube's decoder setup and need to transition to Perform Studio. |
