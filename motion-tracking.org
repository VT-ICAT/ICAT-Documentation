* Overview

At ICAT, Perform Studio and the Cube have motion tracking with Qualisys. Using it, you can define and track rigid bodies that are created with infrared-reflective markers and stream this data in real-time with other computers for art and research with very little latency.

For help with Qualisys, or its software Qualisys Track Manager, look at the official Qualisys manual:
