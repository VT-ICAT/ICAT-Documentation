* Routing Audio

** Dante Controller

Dante Controller is a software application that interfaces users to all hardware devices connected to the associated Dante network. This is the foundation of routing audio in the ICAT facilities. Dante Controller presets have been pre-configured for each of the ICAT spaces, however there are circumstances that require routing adjustments.
 
   [[./.imagegit/7_DC_MacOS_Tx_to_unD32.png]]

*** Loading the Default Presets

1) Launch Dante Controller

   #+attr_html: :width 80px
   #+attr_latex: :width 80px
   [[./.imagegit/dante-controller-logo-small.png]]

2) File > Load Preset (C+l) 
3) Select the appropriate preset and select ok (sort by Most Recent):
   - _Cube:_ “~/Documents/Dante Configuration Files/Cube Master 2020 Sept 2.xml”
   - _Perform Studio:_ "~/Documents/Dante/Presets/PerformStudioDefault.xml"
4) Under Dante Controller 
   1. Apply Preset Window 
   2. Click All on the left pane of Preset Elements
   3. Click Select All
   4. Click Ok 
   #+attr_html: :width 500px
   #+attr_latex: :width 500px
   [[./.imagegit/1_DC_ApplyPreset_numbered.png]]

5) Wait for Dante Controller to apply the preset settings 

   [[./.imagegit/waiting-for-dante-controller-preset.png]]   

   [[./.imagegit/done-dante-controller-preset.png]]

From here, the speaker setup should be appropriate for doing work in the space.

*** Manual Dante Routing

If there is a specific routing that you need for your project, whether that means a couple of mics, or a specific speaker setup, you will need to perform some Dante routing manually.

1. Launch Dante Controller 

   [[./.imagegit/DVS_Icon.png]]

2. Make sure you are under the Routing tab 

3. Signal flows from the Dante Transmitters at the top of the patchbay, to the Dante Receivers at the left of the patchbay. 
   #+attr_html: :width 500px
   #+attr_latex: :width 500px
   [[./.imagegit/dante-controller-audio-signal-flow.png]]

4. Use the plus boxes to reveal the channels on both the Transmitters and Receivers. 

   [[./.imagegit/dante-plus-box.png]]

5. Click the box between the Transmitters and Receivers to route the audio, and wait for the channel to be routed until the green checkmark appears.

   [[./.imagegit/dante-green-checkmark.png]]

6. To remove a channel, click the green check where you want to remove a routing.

7. You can save a preset under File > Save Preset (C+s)

8. Select which devices you want to save and click save. 

   [[./.imagegit/dante-controller-save-preset.png]]

9. Save it with a detailed file name under the Dante Configuration or Dante Preset folder, depending on which studio you are in.

*Be careful routing hardware to hardware, as feedback can occur. It is better to route hardware to computer to hardware, as it will allow for applying gain reductions and possibly stopping feedback. Before routing anything, make sure you know exactly where the audio will be flowing from and to, before routing. If feedback does happen, know where your kill switches are (turn off the speakers, unplug the mic, or stop audio processing immediately.)*

** Dante Virtual Soundcard

Dante Virtual Soundcard is a piece of software to allow for audio output from standard ethernet ports. It is used in all ICAT multichannel sound spaces. You will need it running, if it is not already running.

1. Launch Dante Virtual Soundcard application

   #+attr_html: :width 80px
   #+attr_latex: :width 80px
   [[./.imagegit/DVS_Icon.png]]

2. Under the Settings Tab, make sure the amount of channels you want to use are correctly assigned. 
   - _*In the Cube*_ - you will want 16x16 to drive the 10 stage speakers, and 2 LFE Subwoofers

      [[./.imagegit/dante-virtual-soundcard-cube-settings.png]]

   - _*In Perform Studio*_ - you will need at least 32x32

      #+attr_html: :width 500px
      #+attr_latex: :width 500px
      [[./.imagegit/dante-virtual-soundcard-perform-studio-settings.png]]

3. Click the Start button, and you should now have virtual Dante outputs to the speakers 

The Cube only uses Dante Virtual Soundcard for the floor Genelec speakers. It uses the RedPCI audio interface for the rest. When using the Cube, you generally want to use the Liono soundcard for applications. Liono is an aggregate device that incorporates both the RedPCI hardware audio interface and the Dante Virtual Soundcard together.

The Perform Studio uses Dante Virtual Soundcard for all of its audio outputs. If you do not have a Dante Virtual Soundcard output when you go to route audio from applications, you can know for sure that Dante Virtual Soundcard is not started.

** Reaper

Reaper is typically the DAW of choice here at ICAT for its flexibility in audio routing, easy availability, and cross-platform features. If you need an audio environment strong in audio editing, midi sequencing, and midi automation, Reaper would be a good choice.

*** Getting Sound out of Reaper

_See the Reaper-Templates folder to get some instantly-usable Reaper project setups._

[[./Reaper-Templates/][Reaper Templates]]

**** Sending to Speakers Directly with Reaper

1. Options > Preferences (C+p)
2. Make sure Audio > Device is selected from the left-hand menu

   [[./.imagegit/reaper-audio-devices-tab.png]]

3. Make sure these settings are selected:
   - Check the box for allowing different input and output sources
   - Input Device: <none>
   - Output Device: Liono
   - Check the box Request Sample Rate and set: 48000 

   [[./.imagegit/reaper-cube-audio-settings.png]] *[Need to number this]*

4. Hit Apply, and hit OK.

It is recommended to take the master bus and lower its volume AND mute it to make sure you don't have other stereo sources that you don't need.

**** Using Max msp to Spatialize Reaper with Ambisonics

Since Reaper has a 64 channel limit per track, a typical setup is to use Reaper with Max msp to spatialize your mix with Ambisonics. The overview is as follows: Reaper holds and plays your audio tracks, sends sound through a hardware audio loopback card called MADIface, and Max msp receives your audio to then process it using Ambisonics. From there, you can use an in-house designed plugin in Reaper to send spatial coordinates to the Cube, Perform Studio, or DISIS lab.
   
   #+attr_html: :width 500px
   #+attr_latex: :width 500px
   [[./.imagegit/cube-ambisonic-diagram-signalflow.png]]

*1. Reaper*

1. In Reaper, go to Options > Preferences (C+p)

   [[./.imagegit/reaper-options.png]]

2. Make sure Audio > Device is selected from the left-hand menu

   [[./.imagegit/reaper-audio-devices-tab-numbered.png]]

3. Make sure these settings are selected:

   a. Audio Device: MADIface USB

   b. Output Channels:

   c. Samplerate: 48000

   [[./.imagegit/reaper-to-max-audio-settings.png]]

4. Click Apply, and click OK.

Your audio should now be routing to the MADIface usb audio loopback, allowing you to send audio from Reaper to another application.

*2. Totalmix*

This step is not usually necessary. Only do this step if steps 1 and 3 do not produce audio output.

1. In TotalMix FX, go to File > Load Workspace (C+o)

2. Look for file "~/Documents/Dante Configuration Files/DanteTotalMix MADI Loopback Internal.tmws" in the Cube, or "~/Documents/Dante Presets/Madi Loopback.tmws" in Perform Studio and load it. Note, DISIS is not equipped with a hardware audio loopback device. Please use jack, blackhole, or soundflower there.

*3. Max msp*

1. In Max msp, go to Options > Audio Status
   
   [[./.imagegit/max-audio-status.png]]

2. Under Audio Status, make sure these settings are configured:
   
   Input Device: MADIface USB
   
   Output Device: Liono (for the Cube), or Dante Virtual Soundcard (for Perform Studio)
     
   Sampling Rate: 48000. This should always be the case, but it's important to make sure.

   [[./.imagegit/max-msp-audio-settings.png]]

3. *# Need to direct user to use a template Cube/Perform Studio patch in the same location. maybe put it in ~/Documents/templates?*

4. # Set which studio you are in, in the Max msp template patch

*4. Putting the pieces together*

1. Make sure audio processing in Max msp is turned off, and the master volume on the bottom right is turned all the way down.

2. Play sound from Reaper

3. Look at Max msp while Reaper is playing sound and see if you get any input.

4. After confirming you have audio input from Reaper, slowly turn up the master volume in Max msp on the bottom right

5. If everything is playing correctly, you have successfully routed Reaper in Max and are ready to experiment in the space.

*Note: if you ever need, remember you can always turn off processing in Max msp and it will kill all audio. Also, you can turn off the speakers with the remote for a last resort effort to save your ears in the event something goes wrong.*

*5. Automating Spatialization*

To spatialize from Reaper to Max msp, ICAT has a Reaper template that can be loaded. This is especially helpful if you don’t already have a Reaper project.

1. File > Project Templates > 64ChannelSpatialMixerTEMPLATE

2. *[Include the keyboard shortcuts to show and hide all automation lanes]*

This template has 64 Reaper tracks preloaded with the dummy plugin, a plugin designed to send osc to ICAT’s Max msp template. Reaper tracks 1-64 correspond to Max msp inputs 1-64. You can now draw in Azimuth, Elevation, Distance, and Spread for each track/channel.

Since each track is routed to a single Max msp channel, you should only use mono audio files on each track. 
 
Make sure you do not reorganize the Reaper track order, as this will interfere with the dummy plugin. If you ever accidentally reorganize the Reaper track order, press (C+z) to undo.

*** Getting a Multi-channel Bus for Multi-channel Items/Tracks

# Include here how to do this. It can be tricky for many, as it involves a couple of steps. Maybe we should also include how to set up the project for the best results, including using the dummy plugin to automate osc

# Maybe also include a section for routing audio from reaper to max msp using Tanner’s ambisonic patch setup.

1. Open the routing for the track of your choice using the Routing button in either the main track window or the under the mixer view.

   #+attr_html: :width 80px
   #+attr_latex: :width 80px
   [[./.imagegit/reaper-route-small.png]] [[./.imagegit/reaper-route-big.png]]

2. Use the Track channels: drop down to select as many channels as you want for your track. *Note: you can only have up to 64 channels in a Reaper track at a time.*

3. Make sure Parent channels: is selected properly for your setup.

   [[./.imagegit/reaper-route-multitrack-numbered.png]]

Additionally, if you're unsure where your file's channels are going, open up the routing matrix (A+r) to get a display on where your channels are headed to.

** Max msp

*** Getting Sound out of Max msp 

1) Go to Options > Audio Status
2) Make sure the Audio settings are configured with:
   - _Input Device:_
3) _Output Device:_
   - _The Cube:_ Liono
   - _Perform Studio:_ Dante Virtual Soundcard
   - _Sampling Rate:_ 48000
4) Turn master audio gain on the bottom right all the way down
5) When you are ready to play audio, turn on audio processing and slowly bring up the master gain and listen.

If you are unsure of what input device to use and don’t need audio input into Max msp, use MADIface USB.

You should now have sound out of Max msp.

** Pure Data

Just like Max msp, Pure Data (pd for short) has the ability to output sound independently to speakers.

*** Getting Sound Out of Pd

1) Go to Media > Audio Settings 

   [[./.imagegit/pd-media-audio-settings.png]]

2) Make sure the Audio Settings are configured with:
   1. The Cube
      - Sample rate of 48000
      - Output Devices going to Liono with 140 as the channels for output

      [[./.imagegit/pd-cube-audio-settings.png]]

   2. Perform Studio
      - Sample rate of 48000
      - Output Devices going to Dante Virtual Soundcard with 32 as the channels for output

      [[./.imagegit/pd-perform-audio-settings.png]]      

3) Save All Settings.
4) Click OK
5) When ready to process audio, click the DSP checkbox in the main pd window 

   [[./.imagegit/pd-dsp-on.png]]

Pd will now output its sound to the speakers of whichever studio you are in. 

*Be careful, there are no universal controls for gain in pd like in Max Msp. Use [*~] objects to scale down the gain of your patch.*

** Pd-l2ork/Purr-data

Pd-l2ork is an improved version of pd-extended, developed here by Ico Bukvic, for the Linux Laptop Orchestra. It is highly recommended to use pd-l2ork when dealing with our facilities, as it has many external objects which may help you in routing audio, including and infinite undo.

*** Getting Sound Out of Pd-l2ork

1) Go to Edit > Preferences (C+p)

   [[./.imagegit/pd-l2ork-edit-preferences.png]]

2) Under the Audio Tab, make sure
   1. The Cube
      - Sample rate of 48000
      - Output Devices going to Liono with 140 as the channels for output

      [[./.imagegit/pd-l2ork-cube-audio-settings.png]]

   2. Perform Studio
      - Sample rate of 48000
      - Output Devices going to Dante Virtual Soundcard with 32 as the channels for output

      [[./.imagegit/pd-l2ork-perform-audio-settings.png]]

3) Click Apply and Ok
4) When ready, use the DSP checkbox to enable audio processing.

Pd-l2ork will now output its sound to the speakers of whichever studio you are in. 

*Be careful, there are no universal controls for gain in pd-l2ork like in Max Msp. Use [*~] objects to scale down the gain of your patch.*

* Facilities

** The Cube

*** About

# Can we copy specs from ICAT webpages, or would that not be allowed?

The Cube is a four-story tall black box theater and lab with 140 individually addressable loudspeakers. It is equipped with a 360-degree projection screen called the Cyclorama that is capable of doing stereoscopic video work. The Cube also has capabilities of motion tracking using a high-accuracy camera system called Qualisys. 

*** System Specifications

The Cube is equipped with 140 loudspeakers with five levels of height. It has 4 sub-woofers, 2 lfes, and ceiling speakers.

     [[./.imagegit/cube-signal-flow-diagram.png]]

*** Research

*** Getting Started in the Cube for Sound Work

1. Enter in the Cube. The lights may be off.

2. Find the light control panel. From here, click Work on the touchscreen. *[include picture of this]*

3. Find the white remote to turn on the speakers. It is usually located under the Cube computer. *[include picture of this remote]*

4. Click any ON button on it and wave it around your head to turn on the speaker amplifiers. You should hear a crackle that signals they have been turned on.

From here, you should be ready to work in the Cube for audio. The soundcard that you want to use in the Cube, is Liono. This is an aggregate device that combines the REDNET PCI Dante audio hardware and Dante Virtual Soundcard, giving access to all of the speakers in the Cube. 

** Perform Studio

*** About

The Perform Studio is equipped with 28 individually addressable loudspeakers, Qualisys infrared tracking, and VR headsets. Perform Studio can make for a good choice if you need to do work in the Cube, but can't get time in it, as most work can go from the Perform Studio to the Cube effortlessly.

*** System Specifications

# I am unsure about these specifications

There are 28 loudspeakers located around the room in a cube-like layout, with two levels of height. There are four subs on the ground floor, allowing for a similar bass effect to the Cube's four sub-woofers. 

[[./.imagegit/perform-signal-flow-diagram-resized.png]]

*** Research

*** Getting Started in Perform Studio for Sound Work

1. Turn on the lights at the light switch.

2. The speakers should be kept on, but if they are not, find the white remote to turn them on.

From here, you should be ready to route sound, assuming the computer is set up for routing sound properly. Look at the section "Loading the Default Presets". Use Dante Virtual Soundcard to route audio out to the speakers in Perform Studio.
